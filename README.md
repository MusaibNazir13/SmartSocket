# SmartSocket
<h5>This smart socket software is designed to be automated with different types of end‑point triggering.</h5>

<h3><i>smartsocket.local</i> – This endpoint serves the main web dashboard of this project. Handled internally by the handlRoot() function.</h3>

<h2>Below Endpoints can be triggered from the automated flow on android / raspberry pi / pc ,etc</h2>

- <i>smartsocket.local/s1on</i> – This endpoint is to turn ON the Socket One  
- <i>smartsocket.local/s1off</i> – This endpoint is to turn OFF the Socket One  
- <i>smartsocket.local/s2on</i> – This endpoint is to turn ON the Socket Two  
- <i>smartsocket.local/s2off</i> – This endpoint is to turn OFF the Socket Two  

<h6>The below page is just to show the manual level triggering with a simulated animation based presentation created with the help of HTML, CSS & JS. And includes the Automation Part Demo Video at the End of the simulation</h6>
